# Weather-Report

The goal for this assignment was to produce a web page where a user can search for a city and recieve a five day forecast; city name displaying the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index; and a list of previously searched cities.

## The Process 

I started of with a simple HTML set up that would display the needed text and boxes for the functions using bootstrap. After most of JS was done I went back and structured the site so it is easier to navigate. 

Then I started working on getting the API key to work. I went over previous class examples and read over the suggested resources provided to get a better understanding of how to make a fetch request to provide the information needed. After making a functioning search button I noticed in the developer tools that it would fetch the required info so then I started working on getting it to display on the page. 

Once the user searched for a city I was able to render all the searched cities, but realized that I needed to add an option to clear the results because the searched list was capped at 10 items.

After a while of working on this homework some code would break and when I returned to it I also noticed that I was missing a script so the five day forecast was finally able to be displayed, but am having difficulties with the UV index and listed searches.
